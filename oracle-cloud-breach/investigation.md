# üß† Technical Investigation Report  
**Title**: Oracle Cloud Breach ‚Äì Identity Infrastructure Exploitation via CVE-2021-35587

## 1. Executive Summary

This investigation analyzes the Oracle Cloud breach attributed to threat actor **rose87168**, who allegedly exploited a known vulnerability in Oracle Fusion Middleware to access identity infrastructure and exfiltrate sensitive credentials. As a SOC analyst candidate, I approached this case using publicly available threat intelligence, documentation, and structured reasoning ‚Äî simulating how I would investigate the incident in a real SOC environment.

## 2. Thought Process & Investigation Objectives

When I first saw reports of leaked Oracle credentials on BreachForums, I asked:

> ‚ÄúAre these artifacts legitimate? What kind of access would be required to obtain them? And what vulnerability could explain this?‚Äù

That led me to define the following objectives:

- Identify the most plausible initial access vector  
- Validate the leaked artifacts using Oracle‚Äôs public documentation  
- Profile the attacker‚Äôs behavior and infrastructure  
- Build detection logic using simulated telemetry  
- Recommend response actions based on standard SOC practices

## 3. Phase 1: Entry Point Identification

### üîç Trigger  
The attacker posted samples of Oracle identity artifacts, including `keystore.jks`, `ldap.properties`, and `jps-config.xml`. These files are typically used in Oracle‚Äôs identity and access management stack.

### üîç Vulnerability Mapping  
I searched Oracle‚Äôs CVE history and found **CVE-2021-35587**, a deserialization flaw in Oracle Access Manager (OAM) that allows **unauthenticated remote code execution** via the `/oam/server/Logout` endpoint.

### üß† Reasoning  
According to Oracle‚Äôs [Access Manager documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E52734_01/oam/AIAAG/GUID-D212B4B4-EB25-4969-A297-4A165BB453DF.htm), `keystore.jks` is used for SSO token signing and agent communication. Similarly, `ldap.properties` stores bind credentials for LDAP integration, and `jps-config.xml` configures keystore access policies.

> ‚ÄúIf these files were leaked, the attacker likely accessed Oracle Access Manager or Identity Manager via a known vulnerability ‚Äî most plausibly CVE-2021-35587.‚Äù

---

## 4. Phase 2: Artifact Validation

### üîç Leaked Files  
- `keystore.jks`: Contains cryptographic keys for SSO  
- `ldap.properties`: Stores LDAP bind credentials  
- `jps-config.xml`: Maps tenant identities and access policies

### üîç Source-Based Validation  
I cross-referenced these filenames and structures with Oracle‚Äôs public documentation and community forums. Additionally, threat intel from CloudSEK and CPX confirmed that the leaked hashes matched production credentials.

### üß† Reasoning  
While I don‚Äôt have access to Oracle‚Äôs internal systems, the consistency between the leaked files and documented IAM components strongly suggests that the attacker accessed Oracle‚Äôs identity infrastructure.

> ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt speculation ‚Äî it‚Äôs deduction based on publicly documented architecture and validated threat intel.‚Äù

## 5. Phase 3: Threat Actor Profiling

| Attribute | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Alias** | rose87168 |
| **Activity** | Selling Oracle credentials, demanding ransom |
| **Infrastructure** | `aitism[.]net`, `oraclecloud[.]pro`, ProtonMail |
| **Motivation** | Extortion + reputation building |
| **Behavior** | Posted samples, negotiated ransom, offered barter for zero-day exploits |

## 8. Phase 6: Response Strategy

### üîß Immediate Actions  
- Revoke and rotate exposed credentials  
- Isolate vulnerable Gen 1 servers  
- Notify affected tenants and regulators  
- Block attacker infrastructure at perimeter

### üõ°Ô∏è Preventive Measures  
- Decommission legacy Fusion Middleware instances  
- Enforce scoped access to identity artifacts  
- Integrate IAM telemetry into SIEM workflows  
- Red-team SSO and LDAP flows for impersonation vectors

## 9. Final Conclusion

This investigation confirms that the Oracle Cloud breach was a multi-layered identity compromise. The attacker exploited a known CVE to access Oracle‚Äôs IAM stack, exfiltrated sensitive credentials, and impersonated tenants. My conclusions are based on:

- Public documentation of Oracle‚Äôs IAM architecture  
- CVE mapping and exploit feasibility  
- Threat intel validation of leaked artifacts  
- Simulated detection logic and response planning
